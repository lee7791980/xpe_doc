# XPE Documentation

## Introduction

XPE is an advanced application development platform based on extremely fast XPE technologies developed from the ground up. 

It offers unprecedent speed, scalability, and reliability so you can concentrate on building functionality of your web app.

XPE is built on the following technologies:

1. Completely rewritten core Java library.  While Java is a great language and it is possible to write program that runs just as fast as C or C++, the standard Java library often proves to be the bottlenek.  By completely rewriting the core Java library, we are often able to achieve more than ten times the performance when compared with using the standard Java library.  We also take advantage of modern algorithms that were not available when standard Java library was written.
2. XPE DB: Super-fast realtime database. 
3. XPE Web Server: Highly scalable and fast web server that is twice as fast as Nginx and up to 7 times faster than Apache.
4. XPE MS: Reliable and fast messaging server for writing complex business logics and big data processing.
5. XPE IDE: no need to do any software installation. Just use your browser and you can start coding.
